                    <p>
                        Design has been a big part of my life. Early on I started doing fabrication work on race cars
                        and enjoyed seeing a project develop from beginning to end. I reached a point where I wanted to
                        grow and enter a new form of creativity. This led to me to go back and finish my B.S. in
                        Business at California State University, Northridge where I majored in Marketing. Being in
                        Marketing allowed me to be creative with my work but I needed more, which is what led me to get
                        back into Web Development.

                        <br>
                        I started off as a self-taught developer, but I knew the need to catch up to new technology.
                        Being at UCLA has taught me new skills in developing websites that involve every aspect of the
                        build. The main platforms I got to work with are JavaScript, Node, MySQL and React.js. Every day
                        I am pushing myself to learn more and get involved with new content managers like WordPress and
                        Shopify. I enjoy being able to diversify myself, as well as finding the technologies that I most
                        enjoy working with.
